        <p> After the title card and credits are shown, Tom and Jerry are on a cruise ship heading to a tropical Caribbean beach, and Tom looks out the window seeing a surfer riding a wave. Tom leaps for joy and dashes preparing for surfing and he wakes up Jerry.</p>
        <p> Tom carries his surfboard out to the deck, but runs into many bumps and falls until he finally makes it to the sea out of a fishing boat. Tom lands on a large blue lump that reveals itself to be <span class = "grayShark"> a shark.</span></p>
        <span class = "exitingText"> LOOKS AT TOM AND JARY! </span>
        <p> Tom peers over at the other surfers and he hits the shark on the head seven times until his head has four
          <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf-Bored_Cat">lumps, knocking </a>
          him out Tom surfs a large wave until he spots the shark below him, laughing demonically. Tom pulls himself up to the top of the wave until he is sucked beneath the water and soon encounters the shark again.
          Tom turns his arms such that he rows with them and speeds away from the shark, launching a foot into the air. He taunts the shark again but scrapes the sand and runs into a rock. A mound of sand covers him and the surfboard is up against the rock, giving the mound the appearance of a grave. </p>
        <p>Jerry walks onto the "grave" and drops a flower onto it. He takes off his hat as a salute but grabbed by Tom, who spits out the flower. The sand comes off Tom's head and it is shown a red starfish has grabbed a hold of it.</p>
